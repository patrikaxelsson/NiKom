# This script is used as a simple but effective way to get rid of bots
# attempting to connect.
#
# Requirements:
# - The readline.py and striptelnetcmds.py scripts must be found on the system
#   path.
#
# It's intended to be launched by inetd. Example configuration file
# additions are shown below.
#
# /etc/services:
# mybbs	2323/tcp
# /etc/inetd.conf:
# mybbs	stream	tcp	nowait	nobody	/path/to/botcheck	botcheck 1234 amiga4000 23
#
# In the above example the external port you connect to is 2323, the expected
# answer on the botcheck question is "1234" and if you answer "1234", you will
# be forwarded to the host amiga4000 on port 23.

# All echos are explicitly ended with CRLF to be compatible with various telnet
# clients.
